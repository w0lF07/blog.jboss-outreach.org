##GOOGLE CODE IN

Google code-in is a world-wide competition held by the folks at Google annually which provides a platform for us to explore new and interesting organizations and also help them! With tasks in all branches of cyber-computing such as: Code, User Interface, Documentation/Training, Quality Assurance and Outreach/Research it is the ultimate competition. It mainly aims at open source.

##My Google Code In Experience

I am Swastik Das, a  student of class XI at SAI International School, Bhubaneswar, India.
I heard about Google Code In from Sampriti Panda who has participated in GCI trice earlier and has also been the Grand prize Winner last year.
From childhood computer have fascinated me. I love everything related to them let it be gaming, editing stuffs or coding.
This year I decided to participate in the GCI.
I chose JBoss Community on reading that it is related to Java.
I got to learn about many open-source softwares. They are great to work with. You can use them and also modify and upgrade those softwares which is a great thing.
I learnt how to develop apps, integrate authentication methods, designing webpages and various other stuffs.
At present I know Java, Javascript, C++, C#, Swift, HTML, CSS and I would love to learn more and master in these programming languages too.
Before GCI, I had very less knowledge about opensource. I wasn't aware of the tremendous benefits it gives. But now I love using opensource softwares.

##Mentors
The mentors are really good and cooperative.
They check all our works and also advice us on improving our programming skills and also to rectify to mistakes.
They are really friendly and never step back in clearing doubts or helping in any other ways.

#What I have gained till now from GCI

1. A t-shirt(After completion of 3 tasks)
2. A whole lot of knowledge in the field of web page designing and app development
3. Also got to know about many open source softwares.

##End
In the end I would conclude this by saying that GCI gave me a nice opportunity to improve my coding skills as well as learn many new things. It also gave me new friends and supporting mentors who ere always there to guide us. Whether I get prize or not, I ll forever remember such valuable experience because learning is more important than winning.

Thank You
